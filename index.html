		<h1>Ilia's Creative and Intellectual Pursuits</h1>

		<h2>Capturing Moments: Photography and Videography</h2>
		<p>Photography and videography have become much more than just hobbies for me—they are ways to freeze time and
			tell
			stories visually. I love exploring different environments, from urban streets bustling with life to quiet
			natural landscapes, each offering unique challenges and creative opportunities. Experimenting with lighting,
			composition, and camera settings lets me capture scenes exactly as I envision them or, sometimes, in ways I
			never expected. Videography adds another layer of complexity and excitement: framing motion, working with
			sound,
			and telling narratives that unfold second by second. Whether it's setting up a time-lapse of the night sky
			or
			creating a short documentary-style video, the process of planning, shooting, and editing is as fulfilling as
			seeing the final result.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Exploring new locations for unique shots</li>
			<li>Experimenting with lenses, filters, and color grading</li>
			<li>Editing footage and crafting story-driven videos</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Code as a Creative Tool: Programming and Game Development</h2>
		<p>Programming allows me to build ideas from scratch and bring abstract concepts to life. I enjoy working on
			system-level projects where I can control how everything functions down to the smallest detail. Operating
			systems, tools, and utilities give me an endless playground for problem-solving and optimization. Game
			development, in particular, combines my love for programming with creativity and design. Creating game
			mechanics, designing logic systems, and building custom engines or frameworks gives me the freedom to
			experiment
			with gameplay ideas and interactive experiences. The debugging process, though often frustrating, feels like
			solving intricate puzzles, and watching a working build after hours of coding never gets old.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Developing low-level software and operating systems</li>
			<li>Designing game mechanics and gameplay loops</li>
			<li>Writing custom tools and game engines</li>
			<li>Debugging complex logic and optimizing performance</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Understanding Reality: The Fascination with Physics</h2>
		<p>Physics is where curiosity meets logic. I’ve always been fascinated by the fundamental rules that govern the
			universe. Whether it’s thinking about classical mechanics, thermodynamics, or delving into more abstract
			areas
			like quantum physics and relativity, I enjoy breaking down complex concepts and seeing how they connect.
			Often,
			my understanding of physics also influences my programming and game development work—for example, when
			simulating real-world mechanics or designing realistic in-game physics systems. Reading research papers,
			watching lecture series, and working through derivations in my free time keeps this passion alive and helps
			me
			see the world through a more analytical lens.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Studying theoretical physics concepts in detail</li>
			<li>Applying physics principles in game development</li>
			<li>Running thought experiments and solving physics problems for fun</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Where It All Comes Together</h2>
		<p>While each hobby stands on its own, they often intersect in interesting ways. My programming knowledge helps
			me
			automate editing workflows for photography and videography. My understanding of physics makes my game
			mechanics
			more realistic and grounded. Storytelling techniques from videography influence how I design user
			experiences in
			games. These crossovers not only make each hobby more enjoyable but also allow me to build projects that
			combine
			visual creativity, technical skill, and scientific curiosity—all driven by a desire to create and
			understand.
