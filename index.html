            <p>Ilia stood at the edge of the emerald pasture, gazing across the whispering hills where the wind played games with the tall grass. The flock of sheep, luminous and almost ethereal, grazed in the distance, their wool shimmering like threads spun from stardust.</p>

            <blockquote>“The flock waits for no one,”</blockquote>
            <p>muttered Old Merel, the village shepherd, as he handed Ilia the <strong>Staff of Verdant Echoes</strong>, an ancient artifact said to awaken the voice of nature itself.</p>

            <p>That evening, as twilight painted the sky in deep violets and burnt golds, the sheep began to behave strangely. They formed a perfect spiral, their eyes glowing faintly with an inner light. From the center of the spiral, a low hum began to rise.</p>

            <p>Ilia approached carefully, raising the staff high. The earth beneath his feet seemed to pulse with forgotten rhythms, each beat syncing with his heart.</p>

            <blockquote>“Guardian of the Flock... Your trial begins.”</blockquote>

            <p>The words weren’t spoken aloud. They resonated within Ilia’s mind, woven into the air like an invisible song.</p>

        <article>
            <p>Guided by instinct and the strange melody, Ilia led the sheep up the hill where an ancient stone arch stood forgotten by time. As the first sheep passed through the archway, the fabric of reality shimmered, revealing a hidden realm beyond—the <em>Pastoral Vale</em>, where divine beings shaped the fates of shepherds and kings alike.</p>

            <p>In the vale, Ilia was greeted by the <strong>Woolen Sentinels</strong>, colossal sheep guardians with fleece as soft as clouds but eyes burning with celestial fire.</p>

            <blockquote>“You have proven yourself,”</blockquote>
            <p>they rumbled in unison. <em>“The flock is yours to protect. And with them... the balance of worlds.”</em></p>
