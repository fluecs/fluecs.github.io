    <h2>Mount Shipka (Shipka Peak)</h2>
    <p>Mount Shipka, also known as Shipka Peak, is a mountain summit located in the Balkan Mountains (Stara Planina) in central Bulgaria. It stands at 1,329 meters (4,360 feet) above sea level and is most renowned for its historical and national significance.</p>

    <p>Shipka Peak was the site of a series of key battles during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), particularly the Battle of Shipka Pass. Bulgarian volunteers (Opalchentsi), alongside Russian troops, defended the pass against the Ottoman Empire. Their heroic resistance played a critical role in the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule.</p>
<h2> Shipka Monument</h2>
<p>At the summit, the Shipka Monument of Freedom, built in 1934, commemorates the bravery of the soldiers who fought and died in the battles. The tower-like structure houses artifacts, weapons, and a statue of a lion—symbolizing courage and national pride.</p>
