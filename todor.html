                </h3>
                <p>
                    Perperikon is an ancient archaeological complex located in the Eastern Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria, near the town of Kardzhali. It is considered one of the most important historical sites in the Balkans and dates back more than 7,000 years, with evidence of use from the Neolithic period.

Perperikon was a sacred site for the Thracians, who worshipped gods and conducted rituals there. It later became a Roman, then Byzantine, and finally a medieval Bulgarian fortress. The complex includes a large rock-cut throne, temples, altars, residential quarters, and fortified walls carved directly into the rock.

Many scholars believe Perperikon was the site of the famous Temple of Dionysus, where ancient priests made prophecies. Today, it is a popular tourist destination and a symbol of Bulgaria’s rich cultural heritage.

                    It is believed that in ancient times, an oracle was located here, similar to Delphi in Greece.
